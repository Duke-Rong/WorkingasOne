It is a tool for working groups, help them divide the work more clearly and efficiently so every group member has a clear guideline about what exactly they need to do and what the other memberâ€™s job is. It had a three months development cycle, from design to deploy, a spiral model and MVC design pattern. The tool I use was vueJS as front-end, nodeJS as backend, and firebase as database. "
